            <p>Hello! I am a fourth-year majoring in Economics and minoring in Data Science at UC San Diego. 
                Captivated by the magnitude in which data can propel an organization's growth, I hope to intertwine 
                economic strategies when analyzing data to discover trends that will contribute toward positive outcomes. 
                I am currently interested in hands-on experience within any field of work, but especially the consulting,
                finance, and technology industries to build upon my knowledge on how people's decisions based on data 
                can lead to various solutions. Feel free to connect and reach out!
            </p>
